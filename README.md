In implementing the dynamic background color feature, I used the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure all DOM elements are loaded before the script runs. I'm curious about the impact of this approach on performance and user experience, especially compared to other methods like placing the <script> tag at the end of the body or using defer in the <head>. Are there notable differences in performance or best practices I should consider for future projects?
